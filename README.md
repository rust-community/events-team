# 🗓 Rust Events team

This is the repository for any planning of the [Rust events team](https://github.com/rust-community/team#%EF%B8%8F-events). If you are running an event we would love to offer some tips and contacts along with our experience to make it as smooth as possible.

The Rust events team meets every other week on [Telegram](https://t.me/joinchat/EkKINhHCgZ9llzvPidOssA) at 6pm UTC, where we discuss any [open issues](https://github.com/rust-community/events/issues). We are happy to answer any questions, so feel free to comment or even resolve any issues in this repository 😁.  

Alternatively, you can also email us at [community@rust-lang.org](mailto:community@rust-lang.org).
