# 🗓 Rust Events team

This is the repository of the [Rust events team](https://github.com/rust-community/team#%EF%B8%8F-events). If you are running an event we would love to offer some tips and contacts along with our experience to make it as smooth as possible.

We're also open for contribution of tutorials, guides, and similar.
