You can promote your event by advertising it on Twitter, Reddit and other channels. We understand that the breadth of this may be overwhelming for organizers and would offer to advertise the event for you. If you already have an active Twitter account and/or regularly announce your meetup through other channels you might not need this option.

If you're interested in obtaining stickers and/or swag, please send a short email to [the community team](mailto:community@rust-lang.org?subject=[SWAG]), providing

- Your physical mail address and phone number
- The projected number of attendees for your event
- How many events you're planning to run in the future
- Optionally, if you're interested in a certain type of swag for specific reasons (e.g. you're running a T-Shirt give away)
